## Charles Leclerc's Lap Times Graph in the 2024 Italian GP

The lap times of Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc during 53 laps in the 2024 Italian GP with a one-stop strategy have been visualized, including the types of tires he used.

The 1st, 15th, and 16th laps were removed from the dataset. The reasons are:
- The time for the first lap was recorded as '15:05:02'. The first lap time is usually recorded based on the start time. So, the time the car crosses the finish line during the first lap can be different from a full lap time. This is because the first lap time usually represents the time from the race start to the first crossing of the start line. For this reason, it was removed from the dataset.
- The 15th lap was the lap where Charles Leclerc entered the pit, so the lap time includes the pit entry time as well.
- The 16th round was the lap when the car exited the pit, so it includes the pit time as well.
